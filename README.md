Hello world

It's Kelvin. New to Github. Was a firmware FAE for 8 years. Sounds experienced however, I can read, understand and modify almost any code but not yet able to build/Develop a whole project. I mostly self-learned programming. I guess I need to catch up my fundamental. 
I am learning Pyton, Swift and Ruby now.
